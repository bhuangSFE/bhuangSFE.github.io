## About Me
<img src="/images/headshot_brian.png" width="200">  

Brian started his career as an RF / Antenna design engineer, and got his first experience teaching as a volunteer at the Science Museum of Minnesota. He worked in the industry for 8 years before leaving to pursue a masters degree in curriculum and instruction in secondary education. Since then, he has dedicated his efforts to teaching and inspiring the next generation of youth to be curious and learn how to work with electronics, code, and digital fabrication tools.
â€‹
Brian works to encourage students to tinker around, experiment, and sometimes break and then learn to fix things in their lives. He teaches physics and engineering at an urban high school in Chicago and is the executive director for a non-profit center called HackSchool where students learn to apply engineering toward solving problems in their community. 

He is the author of the book, The Arduino Inventor's Guide, and he has presented professional development workshops for educators at SXSW, ISTE, NSTA, and ASEE in computational thinking, Arduino, and physical computing.
